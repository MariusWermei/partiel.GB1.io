              This Classic quote from the second Mass Effect, in which you can endorse a store on the Citadel for a discount. The player can quickly store on the space station, creating a humorous chorus of the above quote booming out all over the citadel
            <h4>"What is a man? A Miserable little pile of secrets!" Castlevania: Symphony of the Night"</h4>
